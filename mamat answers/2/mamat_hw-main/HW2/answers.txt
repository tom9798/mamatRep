Q1
in all the C programs (excluding hist.c) we have duplicate code.
1. according to the instructions, in each such program,
we tested the arguments in the same way (num of arguments, the argument "-").
we could have done it in different generic program and then in each file,
instead of writing the same long code, just run the generic program at the
beginning of each file.
2. the only different between the min and max programs is only the <=/>=.
we could have used the same program and calculate them both, and "returning"
at the end (using fprintf(stdout, ..) according to the
argument the user enters. for example, we could name this program
"min_or_max.c" and the bash line would be "./min_or_max.exe min".
3. in each program we tested the input line by line
(checking scanf succession, valid garde, ect).
instead we could have written a separate program which
runs the relevant tests. if one of the tests fails, it'll print the relevant
error and exit the main program.
